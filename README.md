*Data Transformation: SQL queries are applied to clean, filter, and aggregate the data for analysis purposes.
*Database Design: Tables are designed to store relevant information such as sales transactions, products, customers, and dates.
*Tableau Integration: The transformed data is connected to Tableau for visualization and analysis.
*Dashboard Creation: Using Tableau's intuitive interface, a sales dashboard is designed with key performance indicators and visualizations.
*Interactive Elements: Tableau's features like filters, parameters, and tooltips are used to make the dashboard interactive and user-friendly.
*Data Insights: The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, top-selling products, customer behavior, and revenue metrics.
